# EVH-EmergencyVehicularHelp
A Hackster.io competition, we designed and developed a device to assist those in bicycle and motorcycle accidents. Using speech recognition, LTE, and other technologies. 

The device's flow is as follows:

User falls off bike --> Device detects irregular position of a bike --> Prompts user asking if he/she is okay --> If positive yes answer --> Device no longer proceeds


If Negative No or Silence detected --> Device asks again and if continous --> Alerts authorities using SMS
